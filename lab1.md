## How to remotely connect to your course specific account:

**Installations**  
  First you will need to install Visual Studio Code in order to... Go to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to download and install it (I already have VS code on my computer so I skipped this step).
My editor looks like this when it is opened:

  You will also need to instal Git. My computer runs windows so I installed git for windows at [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/).
On the set up wizard, I changed the default editor to VS code, besides that, keep all the preferences to the default settings.

**Remotely connecting:**
To remotely connect to your course specific account, first set Git Bash to be your default terminal. I followed the steps from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994), to do this.
Now open a new terminal and it should be a Git Bash terminal.

Then type: ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu, but with your account name. It will prompt you for a password, type your password in to log in. Mine looks like this:

It might ask you if you want to continue to log in, which you will type yes. Mine did not ask me this question.

**Run some commands:**


Now you should be able to run some commands.
